What does Sized mean? Doesn't everything have a static size?

What's "as" mean in the where clause in https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.IntoIterator.html

Why does FromIterator take an IntoIterator, not an Iterator directly?
https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.FromIterator.html

Can you call into_iter() multiple times? I don't think so, since self isn't a reference.

What does From::from() do here https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/alloc/vec.rs.html#2226-2230

Project idea: implement a linked-list.

Try making a struct with a reference field, then make a method that takes a reference and puts it into a struct instance.

Why does hashmap[key] want key to be a reference?

How does moving_method.rs work when Vec doesn't implement Copy, only Clone? Is it because all references implement Copy?
